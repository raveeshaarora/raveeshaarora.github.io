        <p>Hi! My name is Raveesha Arora. I am a rising junior at the University of Maryland, College Park and I am studying computer engineering. For the past
            two summers, I have worked at two different financial companies within their tech department to grow my coding skills in both
            front-end and back-end and also my interpersonal and communication skills. I would love to grow my skill set and contribute by developing new softwares and technologies. 
            My passions include designing a product from front-end to back-end and learning about emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality. </p>
        <p>When I'm not learning new languages or reading up about the new technologies out there, I love</p>

                    <p>For the hackathon held at FINRA, my team created a stock market simulation app catered to millenials. The app contained of different stages
                corresponding to different securities but before a user would enter the next stage, they would have a small
                tutorial on what the security is, the risk involved, and what factors to consider when investing. We won the
                hackathon and got a smart watch as our prize! I worked on the UI of the app to make it appealing to the user and
                also figured how to connect the sign up page to the database in order to store accounts. We won first place for our app!

                    <p> I created a lexer, parser, and interpreter using OCaml to pipeline a text file into a running SmallC program. SmallC is just a smaller version of the C language. This parser will be capable of 
                        parsing expressions, statements, and full programs. The parser operates on a token list assembled by my lexer and creates the correct 
                        statement corresponding to the input. The interpreter is able to interpret variables, int and bool types, equality and comparison operations, math and boolean operations, control flow, and printing. 
                        I used regular expressions and the typing patterns heavily integrated in OCaml to parse and interpret SmallC. In the end, I was able to convert
                        small text files into running a program.

                of the mainframe team under the Global Technology Infrastructure team. I worked on creating an 
                inventory of the top ten features from every team working on the mainframe and automating a 
                recertification process to ensure this inventory is up-to-date. I also created a configuration drift
                script to obtain parameters from the mainframe using REXX and sending them to cloud to compare against
                a gold standard. If the parameters do not match the gold standard, the script would log it and send out
                an alert. Along with this script, I coded other scripts to create a table to sort JIRAs based on priority
                and highlight various values and to subseuently create graphs based on the number of closed JIRAs.

                of front-end and back-end skills as I created a user interface for clients to search for specific data
                within records of bank transactions. I added various navigation tools and search boxes to make the 
                table as easy to search as possible. I also created endpoints to the database in order to populate this
                table with the correct information. While here, they also held an intern hackathon, where we created the 
                Balance app which I talk about above. For this app, my team won first place! Overall, the experience was 
                very fulfilling as I was able to see how tech and finance work together.
